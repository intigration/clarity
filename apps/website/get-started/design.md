# Designing with Clarity

Clarity provides design assets that help designers get started. These assets should be used in a design process that aligns with the Clarity Design System. To jump start your project and align with the Clarity Design System you should download the font resources below and have them installed on your computer. Set up a [free tier Figma](https://www.figma.com/pricing/) account to get started with the Clarity themes, icons and color libraries.

## Primary Font

The default font intended for use with Clarity is [Clarity CIty](https://github.com/vmware/clarity-city). Download and install the [font files](https://github.com/vmware/clarity-city/archive/v1.0.0.zip) on your computer to make sure it is available when using the assets below.

## Figma Libraries

Clarity uses the popular design tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) when designing and documenting components and foundations. Bookmark these resources to re-use Clarity assets in your design process.
